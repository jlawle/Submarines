This lab performs basic communication of send/response type messages between different terminals. A main terminal communicates with the other terminals via child processes.
### Fundamentals
- handling processes with fork(), getpid(), wait()
- process signal handling with signal(), alarm(), kill()
- using system time functions/RNG
- utilizing console window buffers
